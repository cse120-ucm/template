<!--
PR Template Index
Because GitHub does not provide a native UI selector for multiple templates without query parameters, this index helps you choose the correct specialized template.

Usage:
1. Pick the appropriate template below.
2. Click its link to open a pre-filled PR creation page (replace REPO_OWNER and REPO_NAME if not already substituted by GitHub).
3. If you already opened a PR, you can copy/paste the content manually.

Note: Links rely on the `template=` query parameter which only works when creating a NEW pull request (not editing an existing one).

Pull Request Templates are available at https://cse120-ucm.github.io/course_overview/resources/pr_templates/
